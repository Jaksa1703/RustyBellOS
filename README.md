# RustyBellOS
Operating system written in Rust

RustyBellOS is a simple command line operating system built from scratch using the Rust programming language. The goal of this project is to create a minimalistic yet functional operating system that provides a command line interface. Additional features will be gradually added to enhance its capabilities.

The future development of RustOS will focus on:

- Implementing more command line functionalities.
- Adding support for file manipulation and basic filesystem operations.
- Enhancing system stability and performance.
- Exploring opportunities for networking and multi-process support.
